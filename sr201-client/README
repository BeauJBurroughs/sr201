<<TODO>>

Usage
-----

Start the JAR in the target directory that contains all the dependencies: 

> java -jar sr201-client-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar

At first you are presented with the config dialog that lets you specify the boards IP
address and over which protocol you want to connect to it.

Then a dialog with eight toggle buttons is shown. The icons of the buttons represent the
states of the relays. Clicking a button toggles the respective relay state.
