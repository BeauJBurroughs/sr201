# ConfigSR-201.pl

Implementation of the config-client as a PERL command line tool by Christian
DEGUEST.

In addition to the PERL implementation the script contains a French translation
of the config wiki pages.

The script may be especially interesting for Linux users as PERL is much more
common on that platform than Java.
