sr201-config-client
-------------------

This module implements a swing GUI tool that lets you change the settings of the
relay board.

You can change the IP address and subnet mask of the board. The ports are fixed. You can
also change the settings for the cloud service.


Usage
-----

Start the JAR in the target directory that contains all the dependencies: 

> java -jar sr201-config-client-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar

At first everything but the current IP address field is grayed out. You have to connect
once and therefore read the current configuration from the board to activate the other
field.

Once you changed everything you want, all settings are sent at once and the connection is
closed again. Therefore, the GUI will return to grayed out state and you have to reconnect
to activate it again.
