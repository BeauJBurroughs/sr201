sr201-server
------------

This module illustrates how to create a REST interface on top of the normal TCP
connection.

I use Spring Boot to keep the code clean. Of course, Spring boot is complete
overkill. But it produces a stand-alone web server for free.


Usage
-----

Simply start the produces *.jar in the target directory:

> java -jar sr201-server-<version>.jar

It will read the Settings in your user home sr201.xml and listen to the "server.port"
property specified therein. By default this is port 8082.
